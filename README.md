# Thesis Chapter Four

Scripts associated with the production of Chapter Four, Global variation in the relationship between avian phylogenetic diversity and functional dispersion is driven by environmental constraints

1. Script for calculating functional dispersion and phylogenetic diversity of each avian assemblage from Weeks et al. 2020
2. Calculating standerdised effects sizes for phylogenetic diversity and functional dispersion and implementing structual equation models globally and across all regional subsets
3. Structual equation modelling globally and with all regional subsets but with spatial-autocorrelation correction and model comparisons
4. Code for producing figures relating to migration, including global and latitudinal distribution of migratory species and migratory species compared to non-migrator species in principle coordinate analysis.
