# Thesis Chapter Four

Scripts associated with the production of Chapter Four, Global variation in the relationship between avian phylogenetic diversity and functional dispersion is driven by environmental constraints

1. Script for calculating functional dispersion and phylogenetic diversity of each avian assemblage from Weeks et al. 2020
2. Calculating standerdised effects sizes for phylogenetic diversity and functional dispersion and implementing structual equation models globally and across all regional subsets
3. Structual equation modelling globally and with all regional subsets but with spatial-autocorrelation correction and model comparisons
4. Code for producing figures relating to migration, including global and latitudinal distribution of migratory species and migratory species compared to non-migrator species in principle coordinate analysis. 

Dufour_et_al_2019.csv contains migration trait data used to produce figures 6 and 7, 'functional_diversity_indicesFULL.csv'.

standerdised_effect_sizes.csv includes for each site the mean phylogenetic diversity (PDn), mean mean pairwise distance (MPDn), mean pairwise functional distance (MPFD) and standard deviation (sd) for the simulated assemblages at each site. It also includes the empirical score for each of those indices (e) and the standerdised effect sizes of each (ses), as well as the species richness, latitude and longitude of each site. 

functional_diversity_indicesFULL.csv includes the functional dispersion and principle coordinates of each site, as well as their phylogenetic diversity, mean pairwise distance and coordinates.
